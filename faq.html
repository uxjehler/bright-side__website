                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">A number of study findings have lead to conclusions that there are not significant differences in effectiveness
                        across different antidepressants.</p>


                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">But, more recent findings have demonstrated that these study designs may have been masking different
                        effects in sub-groups of people. A team from Yale University were able to double the accuracy of
                        predicting a patient’s response to a given treatment using data and a technique called machine learning.
                        They also found clusters of depression symptoms that were associated with different levels of response

                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">Antidepressants can have rare but serious side effects. It’s important to understand these risks before
                        taking antidepressants and to contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of these serious
                        side effects while taking antidepressants.</p>


                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">The FDA has issued a black box warning for SSRIs and similar medications. These medications may increase
                        suicidal thoughts or behavior, particularly in people age 24 or younger. Watch out for worsening
                        of mood, behavior, or suicidal thoughts, especially during the first few months of treatment. Seek
                        help right away if you experience any of these changes. If you are ever in crisis, dial 911 or visit

                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">Serotonin Syndrome is a rare but life threatening condition where there is too much serotonin active
                        in the brain. Symptoms include fast heart rate, sweating, muscle stiffness or spasms, fever, and
                        confusion. Do not take MAOIs, TCAs, St. John’s Wort, amphetamines, sumatriptan, or linezolid with
                        SSRIs. See a doctor right away if you experience any of these symptoms while taking your medication.</p>


                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding may be increased when SSRIs are combined with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
                        drugs (NSAIDs). Common NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve), and celecoxib
                        (Celebrex).</p>


                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">Depressive symptoms can occasionally be the first manifestation of the up and down cycle between depression
                        and mania in bipolar disorder. If you experience symptoms of mania, such as feeling so good or so
                        hyper that people think you are not acting your normal self, that you don’t need to sleep very much,
                        or that thoughts race through your head and you can’t slow your mind down, you should talk to your
                        doctor immediately.</p>


                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">SSRIs may be associated with increased risk of birth defects. If you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant,
                        or breastfeeding, consult your doctor about weighing the risks and benefits of taking antidepressants</p>


                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">Some antidepressants may impair your ability to perform tasks requiring judgment or motor and cognitive
                        skills. Exercise caution and refrain from dangerous activities, especially when starting your medication.</p>


                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">Hyponatremia (low levels of sodium in the blood) may occur as a result of treatment. Symptoms include
                        mental changes, headache, nausea and vomiting, muscle spasms, and seizures. See a doctor right away
                        if you experience any of these symptoms while taking your medication.</p>


                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">Taking SSRIs can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode
                        of angle closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible
                        to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">Spending time focusing on healthy lifestyle can be an extremely productive way to manage and improve
                        symptoms of Depression. The same activities that make our bodies healthy play an important role in
                        how we can feel emotionally. In order to make sure you are taking care of yourself both physically
                        and emotionally, it's important to do the following:</p>


                    <ul class="paragraph paragraph__left">
                        <li>Be physically active: Make sure you walk or do other exercise for at least 30 minutes per day - even
                            a little bit can make a difference. Argus is a free app that allows you to easily track your
                            physical activity.</li>


                        <li>Eat a healthy diet: Eat fresh, whole foods and plenty of vegetables - avoid processed foods. Drink
                            water and reduce sugar, especially by eliminating sugary beverages like soda and juice. MyFitnessPal
                            offers a free food tracking app to help you ensure you're eating right.</li>


                        <li>Get enough sleep: experts recommend 7-9 hours per night. Sleep Time is a free app that helps you
                            monitor, understand, and improve your sleep patterns.</li>


                        <li>Stop drinking alcohol: If you can avoid alcohol, you're likely to feel better physically and emotionally.</li>


                        <li>Get social support: stay connected or reconnect with family and friends. Consider joining a group
                            or club that interests you.</li>


                        <li>Build resilience: Happify offers a free app to build resilience, gratitude, and positivity.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p class="paragraph paragraph__left-medium">Certain supplements may also be effective in helping to manage the symptoms of depression, including
                        St. John’s Wort (not to be used together with antidepressants) and SAM-e.</p>
